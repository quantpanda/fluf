## Installation

You can install the development version of fluf from
[GitHub](https://github.com/) with:

``` r
# install.packages("devtools")
devtools::install_github("tigerwoodsjr/fluf")
```

You’ll still need to render `README.Rmd` regularly, to keep `README.md`
up-to-date. `devtools::build_readme()` is handy for this.

In that case, don’t forget to commit and push the resulting figure
files, so they display on GitHub and CRAN.
